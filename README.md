# Tiny_ML_for_Smart_Agriculture
This project leverages TinyML models for monitoring agricultural conditions, with a focus on rodent detection using YOLO. It integrates sensors via Arduino and utilizes LoRa for efficient communication. The system is designed to be low-power, enabling real-time analysis and alerts on edge devices, ideal for modern farming.
